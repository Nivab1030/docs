<Update label="08/11/2025">
  **Agent Mode is the new default mode**

  With this upgrade, Kadabra becomes a truly agentic partner—interpreting requests, understanding your codebase, fixing issues, executing complex multi-step edits across files, integrating with external tools, and reducing errors by 91%, so you can build more ambitious apps faster and with less friction.

  Legacy mode (where you don’t use agent) will be sunsetting on September 1, 2025..

  **Real-time analytics on your Kadabra apps**

  Curious how your app is performing in the wild?
  You can now track live traffic and engagement directly inside Kadabra including:

  - Visitors: How many people are using your app
    Pageviews: Which pages get the most attention
  - Visit duration: How long users stay
  - Bounce rate: What percentage leaves instantly
  - Views per visit: How deeply users engage

  The data updates in near real-time so you can spot trends, debug issues, or just celebrate your first users\! Available now under Project Settings → Analytics

  **Pricing change coming to chat mode**

  Pricing for chat mode is moving from 1 credit per message to dynamic pricing, which matches the pricing model for agent mode. This means that each message and response cost is based on the complexity of the message; so some messages and responses cost less than 1 credit, and some, if quite complex, cost more. This change will be rolling out to all users on September 1, 2025.

  **Kadabra business plan**

  Introducing the Kadabra Business Plan, built for teams that need more control, privacy, and flexibility. It includes everything in Pro, plus powerful upgrades:

  - SSO for secure org-wide sign-in
  - Personal projects only visible to you
  - Templates for consistent styling
  - Yearly plans now available

  You can now switch to a yearly subscription for any paid Kadabra plan. Get a discounted rate, simplify billing, and worry less about monthly renewals.

  **Visual edits v2**

  We have refined the visual edits experience after tons of feedback. More responsive, precise, and delightful to use. It’s faster than ever to tweak your UI, fix copy, or adjust layout—without leaving the live preview.

  You can also jump to selected elements in code when using visual edits, tightens the loop between design and implementation.

  **Project invites workflow**

  Invited users must now formally accept or decline access to a project—both from email and magic links. This avoids stale “pending” members and improves collaborator tracking.

  **Search all files in the code editor**

  Use the file search inside the code editor to quickly locate code and add file paths directly into chat.

  **Unified credits bar**

  We’ve shipped a new credits bar that combines all credit types into one clean, unified view—no more jumping between different displays to track usage.

  **Upgraded people tab**

  The People tab in workspace settings has been redesigned. It now includes pagination (20 users per page), search, and filtering by member status—making it much easier to manage large teams.

  **Scales to large workspaces**

  Thanks to backend improvements, we now support massive workspaces with tens of thousands of members without performance issues.

  **Published project badge**

  We’ve added a small but useful touch: all published projects now display a “Published” badge so it’s easier to see what’s live at a glance.

  **Bug fixes**

  - Fixed image upload bug causing \>1% of initial generations to fail if the user wasn’t logged in.
  - Prevents redundant updates when a project is already up to date with the deployed version.
  - You can now disconnect a project from legacy Supabase when disconnecting the org.
  - Reconnecting orgs with invalid tokens is now seamless.
</Update>

<Update label="04/25/2025" description="Kadabra 2.0">
  We’re so excited to launch **Kadabra 2.0**\! This one’s all about collaboration, security, and giving you more control.

  ![Kadabra Two Point Zero Pn](/images/kadabra-two-point-zero.png)

  - We’ve rebranded\! New logo, brighter colors, and a much cleaner UI. Go check it out below— we hope it feels like a glow-up.
  - [Teams](https://docs.kadabra.dev/user-guides/teams): Real-time collaboration is finally here\! Invite others to co-edit apps or create shared team workspaces.
  - [**Simplified Pricing**](https://docs.kadabra.dev/user-guides/messaging-limits#free-vs-paid-plans-comparison) with two clean options: Pro starts at \$25/month and Teams starts at \$30/month.
  - **Security Scan:** Kadabra now checks for vulnerabilities when you publish (if you’re connected to Supabase). This is just the beginning of our work to make vibe coding safer by default.
  - When you try to revert to a past edit after which you ran a migration, Kadabra will tell you we're not reverting the Database.
  - You asked, we listened. [Chat mode](https://docs.kadabra.dev/features/modes#2-chat-mode) is now _way_ smarter and **here to stay** for everyone. It doesn’t make edits, but it _can_ help you reason through problems, plan features, inspect logs, query databases, and more. Think of it as your smart, hands-off pair programming buddy.

  This is a big step forward — and we're just getting started.

  Thanks so much for being on this journey with us
