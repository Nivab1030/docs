## Collaboration in a Workspace

### What is a Workspace?

A workspace is your team's central hub for building and collaborating on projects. Think of it as your digital office where everyone can access shared resources and work together seamlessly.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Centralized Access:** Team members can see, edit, and publish all workspace projects
- **Shared Resources:** Credits and integrations are shared across the workspace
- **Team Management:** Easy collaboration and permission management
- **Unified Experience:** Consistent workflow for all team members

<Warning>
  **Premium Feature:** Granular permission control and role assignment require a paid subscription plan.
</Warning>
