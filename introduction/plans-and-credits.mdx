# Plans and credits

Kadabra is priced for teams that want to ship real automations and keep governance tight. Plans combine seats, environments, and a monthly credit pool that powers AI steps and runtime features. Annual billing includes a discount. All prices are placeholders. Replace before publish.

> For security and support details see **Security** and **Support policy**.

## Plans at a glance

| Plan | Best for | Seats included | Environments | Projects | Monthly credit pool | Data retention | Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starter** | Solo makers and trials | 1 Creator | 1 env | 1 project | 50k credits | 7 days | Community |
| **Team** | Small teams shipping first flows | 3 Creator + 3 Reviewer + unlimited Viewer | 2 envs | 3 projects | 500k credits | 30 days | Email support |

| **Enterprise** | Scale, governance, and advanced security | Custom | 4 envs | Unlimited | Custom | Custom | SLA, TAM optional |

- **Creator** can design, edit, test, and publish flows.
- **Reviewer** can approve changes, run flows, and view logs.
- **Viewer** can view dashboards and logs without making changes.

## Credits 101

Credits meter usage across AI steps and runtime features. The goal is to make costs predictable and keep you focused on shipping tasks, not micro managing tokens.

### What consumes credits

- **LLM steps** - every AI node counts input tokens and output tokens. 1 credit equals 1k tokens counted on the larger of input or output per step. Rounded up per step.
- **Embedding steps** - 1 credit equals 2k tokens embedded.
- **Toolformer actions** that call external tools from an AI node - billed like LLM steps.
- **Long running work** - queued work beyond 60 seconds per step consumes 1 credit per extra minute, rounded up.
- **Headless browser** steps if enabled - 1 credit per minute of active session.

### What does not consume credits

- Drafting flows on the canvas
- Test runs in Dev with sample data up to a small daily cap
- Pure deterministic steps like transforms, routers, simple API calls
- Viewing logs, metrics, and dashboards

> Bring your own vendor keys where possible to control third party spend. Kadabra respects per key budgets and caps.

## Credit math examples

**Example A - content brief flow**  
2 AI steps per run. Average 800 input tokens and 300 output tokens per step.  
Per step billed tokens = max(800, 300) = 800. Credits per step = 800 or 0.8k rounded up to 1 credit.  
Credits per run = 2 credits.  
If you run it 10k times per month you will use about 20k credits.

**Example B - enrichment flow with embeddings**  
1 embedding step at 4k tokens + 1 AI step at 1.5k output tokens.  
Embedding credits = 4k or 2 credits. AI step credits = 1.5k or 2 credits.  
Credits per run = about 4 credits.

**Example C - long running headless step**  
Browser session lasts 3 minutes. Credits = 3. Combine with any AI steps.

Use the **Monitoring** page to track actual usage per flow and set budgets.

## Limits and guardrails

- **Per run caps** - set a maximum credits per run. The flow pauses for approval if a run would exceed the cap.
- **Per flow monthly budgets** - set budgets by flow. Runs throttle or pause once budgets are met.
- **Workspace caps** - stop runaway use by setting a workspace wide limit with alerts and optional kill switch.
- **Rate limits** - avoid vendor throttling by configuring per integration rate limits.
- **Data retention** - control how long to keep input and output snapshots per plan.

---

## Overages and top ups

- If you exceed the monthly pool we keep running your flows using **overage pricing** or stop at your chosen hard cap.
- You can **top up** credits at any time. Top ups never expire.
- Unused monthly credits **do not roll over** unless on Enterprise with a custom agreement.

---

## Seats and roles

- **Creators** draft flows with the Kadabra Agent, edit on the Visual Canvas, and publish to Stage and Prod.
- **Reviewers** approve changes, manage policies, and perform rollbacks.
- **Viewers** see dashboards, runbooks, and read only logs.
- **Owners** manage billing, SSO, and workspace level settings.

Map seats to least privilege needed. Use service accounts for CI and programmatic publish.

---

## Environments and projects

- **Environments** isolate credentials, webhooks, and logs. Typical setup is Dev, Stage, Prod.
- **Projects** group flows, secrets, and dashboards by domain, such as GTM, Ops, or Support.
- **Promotion** moves a version from Dev to Stage to Prod with checks and approvals.

See **Publish** for details.

---

## Billing and invoices

- Monthly or annual billing. Annual includes a discount.
- Invoices include a usage breakdown by flow, env, and integration.
- Pay by card or invoice. Enterprise can use PO and wire.
- Taxes are added where required.

---

## Add ons

- SSO SAML and SCIM user provisioning
- Advanced audit export to your data warehouse
- Dedicated region or VPC deployment
- Custom tokenization or PII redaction rules
- Higher retention tiers
- Headless browser pack

> Some add ons are Enterprise only. Talk to sales.

---

## Upgrading or downgrading

- Upgrades are prorated and effective immediately.
- Downgrades take effect next billing cycle. Keep overage coverage until then.
- You can export flows and runbooks at any time.

---

## Refunds

We do not offer refunds for a billing period already in progress. If something went wrong reach out via **Support** and we will work with you.

## Glossary

- **Credit** - the unit used to meter AI and runtime usage.
- **Project** - a workspace scoped folder for flows, secrets, and dashboards.
- **Environment** - Dev, Stage, Prod isolation for secrets and webhooks.
- **Run** - a single execution of a flow with full trace.
