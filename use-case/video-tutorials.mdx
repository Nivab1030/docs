<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build an AI-Powered Calorie Tracking WebApp">
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0zhLzcVJRI?si=7vcZf5eoxIobOxdE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    This tutorial, we'll walk you through creating an AI-powered calorie tracking app with [Kadabra](/kadabra-f9060f1e/kadabra-f9060f1e/editor/main#build-an-ai-powered-calorie-tracking-webapp), complete with authentication, a beautiful responsive design, OpenAI integration, and deployment to production.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting Up the Foundation">
        The foundation of any Kadabra project is a good prompt. For this app, here’s an example:

        ```
        Create a calorie tracking app with the following features:
        Landing page, dashboard, and a meals page.
        Input fields for meal descriptions or images, with analysis powered by GPT-4.
        Daily progress tracking and integration with Supabase for authentication and database management.
        Beautiful and mobile-responsive UI.
        ```

        Once Kadabra generates the UI skeleton:

        - Review the navigation setup and landing page design.
        - Iterate on the prompt to refine the layout and ensure mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          Be explicit about starting with the UI. Kadabra works best when tasks are broken into clear steps. For instance, outline navigation, page structures, and design themes early in the prompt
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Designing the UI">
        Kadabra emphasizes a step-by-step approach, akin to constructing a building:

        - Start with **scaffolding**: Plan your app structure (e.g., user experience flow, page layout).
        - Add the **first layer**: Create empty pages with basic design elements.
        - Refine the **details**: Add colors, animations, and mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          If you have pre-made designs in [Figma](), you can take screenshots and include them in your Kadabra prompt. Providing high-resolution images ensures better results.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Integrate Supabase for Backend and Authentication">
        Once the UI is ready, it’s time to add backend functionality:

        1. Set up a [**Supabase**]() **account** and create a project.
        2. Link it to Kadabra by pressing the "Connect Supabase" button.
        3. For data storage, Kadabra will generate SQL tables. For instance:

        - A `profiles` table to store user information.
        - A `meals` table linked to users for tracking daily entries.

        <Note>
          Use row-level security (RLS) rules in Supabase to ensure user privacy. Kadabra can handle this for you automatically.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Integrating OpenAI for Meal Analysis">
        The magic of this app lies in its AI capabilities. To analyze meals:

        1. Obtain an [OpenAI API key]() from your developer dashboard.
        2. Use [GPT-4]() for analyzing meal descriptions or images.
        3. Ensure API keys are securely stored in Edge functions to prevent unauthorized access.

        **Features to include:**

        - **Analyze meal descriptions**: Estimate nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
        - **Image recognition**: Upload a meal photo, and GPT-4 will extract a description and nutritional data.

        <Note>
          _Pro Tips for OpenAI Integration:_

          - Use **function calling** for structured responses, ensuring data is formatted correctly for database insertion.
          - Test the functionality by asking the app to analyze simple meal entries like “2 eggs.”
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Implementing Payments with Stripe">
        To monetize the app, add subscription-based payments:

        1. Create a [Stripe]() account and set up a product (e.g., “Standard Plan” for $12/month).
        2. Integrate Stripe with Kadabra by adding the API key and product price ID.
        3. Redirect non-paying users to the landing page. Only paying users can access the main app.

        <Note>
          _Additional Tips:_

          - Enable Stripe’s **customer portal** to let users manage subscriptions (e.g., cancel or update payment methods).
          - Test payments in Stripe’s test mode using the provided test credit card details.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Testing and Debugging">
        Errors are a natural part of development, and Kadabra simplifies debugging:

        - Use the **"Try to Fix"** button whenever a build error occurs.
        - For backend issues, check Supabase logs for detailed error reports.
        - If deploying to [Netlify](), review deployment logs for any build issues. Share logs with Kadabra to get tailored fixes.

        <Note>
          If you get stuck, revert to a previous version using Kadabra’s "Revert" feature. This saves credits and time.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploying Your App">
        Once your app is ready, deploy it with Kadabra or Netlify:

        1. Use Kadabra’s deploy feature to host the app on a default domain.
        2. For custom domains:

        - Connect your [GitHub repository]() to Netlify.
        - Purchase a domain and configure [DNS settings]() to link it to Netlify.

        <Note>
          Update your app’s metadata (favicon, meta tags, OG image) for better branding and SEO.

        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Creating Dynamic Backgrounds and Animations">
        Kadabra now supports seamless integration of animated and interactive elements using **p5.js** and other libraries.

        #### **Example Project: Travel Agency Website with Interactive Flags**

        A recent live demo showcased how to build a travel agency landing page featuring:

        1. **An animated hero section** with flags dynamically appearing and moving in response to mouse interactions.
        2. **A sticky-scroll section** that changes based on the user’s scroll position.
        3. **Interactive hover effects** where images react to user movements.

        #### **How to Implement Animated Effects**

        To create these effects, users followed this simple process:

        - **Define the desired animation:**

        <Note>
          Make the background interactive with floating elements that move away when hovered over.
        </Note>
        - **Use p5.js to generate effects:**
          - Implement a chromatic smoke pattern.
          - Swap out static images for dynamic flag animations.
        - **Enhance user experience with physics-based interactions:**
          - Make elements move dynamically based on user actions.

        <Note>
          If an animation isn’t working, use Kadabra’s chat mode to debug and refine the effect with step-by-step AI guidance.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Importing Custom Elements from External Libraries">
        With [**21st.dev**](), users can now integrate pre-built UI components seamlessly into Kadabra projects.

        1. Browse **21st.dev** for a button design.
        2. Copy the AI-generated prompt.
        3. Paste it into Kadabra and replace an existing button.

        This approach accelerates design workflows and allows for more polished, visually cohesive interfaces.

        <Note>
          This same method works for importing animation presets from **motion.dev**, making it easier to add high-quality motion effects without custom coding.

    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fILdgFNqvmU?si=_Xg-XTMTQuBN7bE1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Establishing the Concept and Audience">
        Before branding, we defined our core goals:

        - **AI-powered chat** for real-time Spanish conversations.
        - **Automated quizzes** for quick practice sessions.
        - **Structured learning** with lesson storage and progress tracking.

        This helped shape our branding choices, ensuring they aligned with the app’s purpose.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Naming & Domain Selection">
        We aimed for a short, memorable name that reflected the **learning journey**. Using AI, we brainstormed and landed on **Ruta** (Spanish for “route” or “path”).

        #### **Process:**

        - **Brainstormed names** using AI for catchy Spanish words.
        - **Tested options** like "Camino" and "Verbo," but "Ruta" stood out.
        - **Checked domain availability** and secured **rutaapp.com** immediately.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Creating a Visual Identity">
        We quickly designed the brand:

        - **Logo**: A **compass-themed** icon sourced from design libraries and edited in Figma.
        - **Font Pairing**: Used a **bold, modern typeface** for the logo and a readable UI font for the app interface.
        - **Color Palette**: A **Tailwind CSS blue** scheme to symbolize travel and discovery.
        - **Styling Inspiration**: Experimented with **neo-brutalism**, tweaking contrast, shadows, and borders to create a visually engaging UI.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Building a Cohesive User Experience">
        Using Kadabra, we ensured **visual consistency** across the app:

        - **Landing Page**: AI-generated with a dynamic, engaging hero section.
        - **Dashboard & Course Pages**: Styled to match the brand’s identity.
        - **Iterative Styling**: Applied **neo-brutalist** elements to test different design styles.
        - **User Flow Testing**: Ensured seamless navigation from signup to real-time chat.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Start with Inspiration">
        Every project starts with a clear vision. For this MVP, the client wanted an **AI-powered dashboard**.

        To kickstart the design process:

        - Took a screenshot of a relevant landing page.
        - Asked [**ChatGPT**]() to describe the design in detail—layout, sections, colors, and typography.
        - Used this breakdown as the **foundation for building in Kadabra**

        <Note>
          _Describe this landing page in detail, including layout, sections, colors, and typography._
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Build the Core with Kadabra">
        Once the blueprint was ready, Kadabra handled the **entire foundation of the app**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="GitHub Integration">
        Kadabra **automatically creates a** [**GitHub repository**]() for your project, syncing updates effortlessly. **Workflow:**

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Generate a repo in Kadabra.">
            
          </Step>
          <Step title="Transfer it to your GitHub account.">
            
          </Step>
          <Step title="Clone it into Cursor for advanced coding.">
            
          </Step>
        </Steps>
        This keeps everything organized and **developer-friendly** when custom logic is required.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Supabase for Authentication & Database">
        With Supabase integration, setting up the backend was a breeze.

        - **Added authentication** for user signups/logins.
        - **Set up a database** to manage profiles and app data.
        - **Connected APIs** without writing redundant boilerplate code.

        <Note>
          _Add Supabase authentication to the app, allowing users to sign up and log in using their email._
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Email Automation with Resend">
        To ensure smooth communication, Kadabra’s [**Resend integration**]() handled transactional emails.

        - **Welcome emails** for new users.
        - **Action-triggered notifications** within the app.

        <Note>
          _Set up an email workflow using Resend that sends a welcome email to users upon signup and a notification when they complete an action._
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Chat with Your Codebase">
        Kadabra’s built-in **chat feature** makes managing large projects effortless.

        You can:

        - Ask which features from the PRD are completed.
        - Quickly reference task breakdowns.
        - Get a high-level project overview instantly.

        <Note>
          _Based on the PRD and task breakdown, list all completed features and highlight pending tasks._
        </Note>
        This feature **saves hours** by keeping teams aligned on progress.
      </Step>
      <Step title="OpenAI for AI-Powered Features">
        The app needed AI-driven data summarization.

        - **Kadabra’s** [**OpenAI integration**]() made API setup seamless.
        - AI functionality was up and running in **minutes**.

        <Note>
          _Integrate OpenAI APIs to summarize user data input and display the results on the dashboard._
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="AI Image Generation with Replicate">
        For AI-powered visuals, **Replicate integration** allowed users to generate images dynamically.

        - Enabled **custom AI-generated visuals** inside the app.
        - Required minimal configuration.

        <Note>
          _Add Replicate integration to generate AI-powered images based on user inputs._
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Payments with Stripe">
        Handling **subscriptions and transactions** was effortless with Stripe integration.

        - **Set up payment workflows** for different plans.
        - **Tested transactions** for reliability.
        - **Synced Stripe dashboards** for client visibility.

        <Note>
          _Integrate Stripe into the app to allow subscription payments, including a dashboard for users to manage their plans_.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="From Kadabra to Cursor for Finalization">
        Once the app was functional, it was **synced to GitHub and imported into** [**Cursor**]() for:

        - **UI refinements**
        - **Advanced backend logic**
        - **Final debugging & optimisations**

        Cursor provided a **developer-friendly environment** to polish the project before deployment.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    This streamlined workflow—**ChatGPT for planning, Kadabra for building, and Cursor for refining**—significantly **reduces MVP development time**.
